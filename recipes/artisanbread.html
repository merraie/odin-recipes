            <h2>Description</h2>
            A no knead bread recipe without special equipment,
            stand mixers or dough hooks? YES! 
            If youâ€™ve never made bread before,
            you will LOVE how easy and forgiving this
            recipe is. Bread lovers will appreciate the
            thick, chewy crust and soft open crumb,
            similar to Ciabatta,
            perfect to smother with butter.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups bread flour, or plain/all purpose (15.8 oz. or 450g)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried, instant or rapid rise yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (375 ml) warm water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, yeast and salt in 
                a large bowl.Add water and oil, mixing to
                incorporate all of the ingredients together.
                Dough will be wet, sticky and shaggy.</li>
            <li>Lightly spray the top with cooking oil spray. 
                Cover with plastic wrap
                 and place a dry tea towel over the top.</li>
            <li>Leave in a warm, draft-free place for 2-3 hours,
                 until doubled in size. Dough will have a lot of 
                 little holes or bubbles and be wobbly like jelly.</li>
            <li>Place a large (10-inch or 26cm) dutch
                 oven or heavy based pot in the oven with a lid. 
                 Preheat oven to 450Â°F 
                (230Â°C) 30 minutes before baking.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour work surface and plastic spatula 
            with up to 1 tablespoon flour. Scrape dough out of 
            bowl onto work surface with spatula. Sprinkle the top
             of dough with a large pinch of flour and fold it over on 
             itself with the spatula 
            (about 5-6 folds). Roughly form a round shape.</li>
            <li>Measure out a large piece of parchment paper,
            large enough to transfer the dough into the pot. 
            Place paper next to the dough and roll dough onto the paper,
            smooth side up. Carefully move it to the centre of 
            the paper and reshape if needed, or shake pan a couple of
            times to evenly distribute dough. 
            (It will even out while baking.)</li>
            <li>Loosely cover with plastic wrap 
            and let rest while oven is preheating.</li>
            <li>Use oven mitts to carefully remove 
            hot dutch oven from oven. Grab the parchment 
            paper from each end to pick up
            the dough and transfer it into the pot.</li>
            <li>Cover with lid and bake for 30 minutes, 
            then remove lid and bake for an additional 12-15 minutes,
             until loaf is beautifully golden browned.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a wire rack 
            to cool for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
